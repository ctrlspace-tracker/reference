## Intellij Shortcuts

Its interesting to use shortcuts and the goal must be to avoid using the mouse as much as possible while development.
You can use plugins such as Key promotoer X and Presentation plugins to capture the frequently used commands and observe 
the shortcuts. 

You can also use the keymap in the intellij preferences to customize the shortcut behaviour to your requirements.
